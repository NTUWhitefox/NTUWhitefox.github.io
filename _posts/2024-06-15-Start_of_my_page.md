So, welcome you guys. This is the start of my personal page.

Time flies. It has been a week from the end of last semester. I have lots to share, but I still have some works to do. 
Ok, I don't wanna talk about my score and GPA in this post. Maybe I will talk about it next week?

Days in summer vocation are relaxing, but I think I should learn something new or study lecture in next semister, like statistics. 
Rumor has it that statistics in our department is quite difficult. Shit, I am anxious about it now. 

By the way. I have a sore throat for two days. I don't know whether it is covid or not, but quite unconfortable.
