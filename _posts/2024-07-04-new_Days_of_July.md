Time flies, two weeks of summer vocation has passed, and I just finish a test. The result will be out in August so let us forget it right now.
Now I wonder what to do in the rest of the month. I really want to make my own gane, but I have no idea how many time and efforts it will take.

By the way, my spring youtube recap is out, you guys should check it out!
